Cococo
======

Cococo is an iOS game. Goal is to hatch a chick from an egg.
Game is available on AppStore for free.

It is created with PhoneGap framework.
So you can easiely port it on Android or so.

Main code is in JS, and you can modify index.html
to run game in your desktop browser.
Please look into index.html for instructions.

I used images and sounds, found on the Web.
